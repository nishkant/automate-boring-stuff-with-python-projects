Here are the solutions of the projects given in the book by _AI Sweigart_	   "[Automate the boring stuff with python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)" üïµÔ∏è

It is a practical programming book for beginners with many great programming application based learning stuff.

As the solutions of the "practice projects : given at the end of each chapter" were not given in this book , I am uploading my solutions which I am making while learning from this book .
I will upload the solutions to the projects as  I will solve them. üëπ
Also there are some chapter projects , related to which I will also upload some code as for what I learned , or some modifications etc.

As I am a mere beginner please pardon my limited knowledge of the subject which can make the code time complex or long.
Suggestions , corrections and improvements are always welcome üòÑ

Have fun learning.... üåü
